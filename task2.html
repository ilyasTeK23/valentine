          As the only accredited orangutan sanctuary in the country and one of a handful of accredited chimpanzee sanctuaries, the Center for Great Apes has been rescuing great apes for 30 years. 
          The Center for Great Apes does not receive funding from the federal or state governments. 
          We are supported by donations from generous people like you, who care about the future of our orangutans and chimpanzees (both endangered species).</p><a href="https://centerforgreatapes.org/our-team/"><button>Help</button></a></div>
